## Authentication

_AppStoreConnect CLI_ requires the use of an AppStore Connect API Key. See the [Apple documentation][docs-api-key] for more details on how to create these keys.

When using _AppStoreConnect CLI_ commands you need to specify the API Key Issuer and API Key ID. 
This can be done via the `--api-issuer` and `--api-key-id` command line options or `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` and `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` environment variables respectively.

The API private key is expected to be named `AuthKey_<api-key-id>.p8` and located in one of the following directories:

- `./private_keys`
- `~/private_keys`
- `~/.private_keys`
- `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys`

The API private key can also be stored in the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`.
